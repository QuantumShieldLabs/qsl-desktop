# DECISIONS (qsl-desktop)

This log records repo-local decisions only. All directive, queue, and
decision AUTHORITY lives in the qsl-protocol governance spine (see
CLAUDE.md); spine decisions about this repository are recorded in the spine's
DECISIONS.md (registration: D-1279; bootstrap: D-1280).

- **ID:** D-0001
  - **Status:** Accepted
  - **Date:** 2026-07-19
  - **Decision:** Bootstrap this repository as a SATELLITE of the
    qsl-protocol spine per the spine's D-1279 registration (DOC-PROG-004
    v0.2.0 step 3): land the single required `rust` CI gate
    (.github/workflows/ci.yml; branch protection follows the first merge as
    the operator's companion step), the community-health set (LICENSE,
    NOTICE, README, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING), the pointer
    CLAUDE.md (the repository's root commit), this DECISIONS log, and a
    minimal zero-dependency placeholder crate (`qsl-desktop`, version-line
    binary + one unit test + committed Cargo.lock) so the gate checks
    something real. No Tauri, no GUI code, no qsc dependency — the GUI
    skeleton is a future spine-governed lane.
  - **Rationale:** The repository's first commits must be governed work; the
    CI pipeline must be proven before the application exists (prove the
    pipeline, not the app).
  - **References:** spine NA-0657 (directive D593); spine D-1279 (the
    registration and its owed list) and D-1280 (the bootstrap closeout);
    spine D-1278/NA-0655 (community-health forms); spine D-1265/D578 (the
    qsl-server satellite pattern).

- **ID:** D-0002
  - **Status:** Accepted
  - **Date:** 2026-07-19
  - **Decision:** Land GUI slice A — the serverless skeleton — per spine
    directive D595 (QSL-DIR-2026-07-19-595, as amended at approval; spine
    decision D-1282; lane NA-0659): the Tauri v2 scaffold replaces the
    placeholder crate (src-tauri joins the bootstrap's empty [workspace];
    the placeholder binary is retired); qsc is consumed as a rev-pinned git
    dependency at spine main `81143dcd3b4a7beead7d0f4e742717a4310e2409`;
    the CI gate gains the Tauri system-dependency apt step with the
    required context name kept exactly `rust`; the frontend is static
    vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with zero npm/node (operator rationale: no JS
    supply chain in a security product's build); the core-call layer
    encodes the four startup rules (env+policy+InApp routing once before
    threads; drain-after-every-call into a bounded buffer; lock state only
    via the qsc NA-0658 one-call surface; strictly-serial single-flight
    spawn_blocking), each test-proven; the S0/S1/S2 launch state machine
    uses the app-level `vault.qsv` existence probe (spine F2 ruling; the
    filename coupling is recorded on the spine ledger); wizard steps 1–2,
    the unlock screen rendering the typed retry-after/attempts values, the
    two-step app-level forgotten-passphrase erase (file removal only),
    idle autolock (on, 15 min default), the empty three-pane main window
    ("no server configured"), and Settings Vault/Security bound to the
    real qsc protection surface (identity export absent by design).
    Slice A contains ZERO networking code; the server-connectivity surface
    (wizard step 3, error taxonomy, Settings Server pane, four-state
    status line) is slice B — OWED, the committed successor concern.
  - **Rationale:** House lane sizing (one concern per lane) split step 5 on
    the network/zero-network line; the launch state machine derives
    everything from what exists on disk, so slice-A installations sit on
    the deferred path in S2 until slice B lands — no migration, no wizard
    re-entry.

    NA-0658 (the vault-protection surface this slice binds to); spine
    D-1272 / NA-0649 (the GUI-surface functions); the 2026-07-16
    GUI-readiness investigation (the four startup rules, §4.1 system
    dependencies).
